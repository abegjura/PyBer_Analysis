## PyBer_Analysis
Module 5

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the project was to analyze data for a ridesharing company called PyBer to calculate metrics related to the total weekly fares for each city it operates. Data sets with ride &city data were sourced to calculate the following metrics:
  - Total rides
  - Total drivers
  - Total fares
  - Average fare per ride
  - Drivers for each city.

We were also asked to create a new data frame to find the average fare per week from January 1st 2019 to April 29th 2019 for each of the city classification (Urban, Suburban, Rural). We created graphical representation of the data frame by using a line graph visualizing the output of total weekly fares for each city type for the before mentioned period. 

## Results
With the data provided we produced a set of key outputs in various forms to represent the data metrics we calculated for the different city types - Urban, Suburban, Rural:

Here we created a line chart showing the Total Fare by City Type for Jan 2019 through April 2019:

##Summary

### Rural Cities:
Represents the least amount of rides and fares when compared to the other two city types (Urban & Suburban). Surprisingly the data does show that this city type has the highest average fare per ride. This is due to Rural areas having lower population and destinations being further apart in distance. Hence the higher average fare

### Suburban Cities:
Data shows this city type as being middle of the pack. Suburban rides and fares are fairly-solid and do not require much attention or investment. 

### Urban Cities: 
This city type has the highest in rides and fares.  It is the highest performing of all cities and requires continued investment and focus as it represents a lion share of the activity and fares.
